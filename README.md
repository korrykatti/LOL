LOL is a document reader similar to other text to speech converters but what makes it different is it is really very small in size and secure as it is open source . Its currently tested to work on Linux. Would be nice if you would test it on other OS and tell than on issues. 













Thanks :D

# How to use
1) go to the folder of the script

3) open terminal and ```python3 lol.py```
4) Just give the filename and enjoy listening
5) If you want to change the accent just go to lol.py and in line ```engine.setProperty('voice', voices[11].id)``` change 11 to the voice index in your system
6) If you want to slow down or fast the speech go to ```engine.setProperty('rate', 160)``` and replace 160 with whatever wpm you want
